<b>UNIT 1 SUMMARY</b><br><br>

The key structure of the web includes:<b><em>The web, HTML, URLS, HTTP,

<br>and web applications.</em><br><br>

Major concept</b><br>


<p><b>1.</b></b>You search using your browser(<b>Firefox,Chrome, or Internet Explorer</b>)</p>

<p><b>2.</b>Your search is passed though the <em>internet</em> until it reaches the <em>servers</em>,<br>
where files are stored for access.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> After the files are gatherered the process 
loops back around so you can see the<br> results of your search on your screen.</p>

<p><b>Additional Concepts</b></p>

<p>Computers are "<em><b>stupid</b></em>" because they need very precise instructions to complete<br>
a seemingly simple task.</p>

<p><b>Text content</b> is "<em>what you see</em>" as opposed to <b>Markup</b> which is "<em>what it looks like</em>."</p>

<p>The difference between <em>Inline vs Block</em> elements is the fact that block elements
<br> have a measurable box placed around them, and inline simply is text.</p>
